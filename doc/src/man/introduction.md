# Introduction

Electrostatic interactions are a major contributor to protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions. In contrast to other molecular interaction components, they can be significant over medium to long distances and are thus crucial for molecular visibility. Research areas such as rational drug design require accurate estimates of potentials and free energies influenced by electrostatics. One major challenge in this context, however, is the treatment of the solvent the molecules are immersed in, i.e., water in a biological context. Strong simplifications of the structure of such polarizable and highly structured solvents are commonplace to achieve the required computational efficiency, but invariably lead to inaccuracies.
